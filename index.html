            <h3 class="title">ABOUT SHE</h3>
            <p class="text">
                An evaluation of the available statistics depicts a glowing picture on the academic status of our female students in the state owned engineering colleges. However the unpleasant truth is that a good number of these female academic achievers fail to shine later on in their carrier and   number of alumnae who dwell in the lead roles in jobs are only handful. Numerous studies from the work place have revealed that many    female engineers enter the engineering work place and they choose to leave because of lack of peers and mentors and they fail to occupy technical leadership position. This dire reality has forced us to put some serious thoughts on the puzzling question “Why So Few?”. And we have identified the burning need to take a more assertive role in imparting our women students, the exposure and experience they need to eventually   fulfill their carrier demands and to assume leadership roles facing all challenges.  With this backdrop, the program Scheme for her Empowerment in Engineering education (SHE)   is envisaged.<br>    </p>
